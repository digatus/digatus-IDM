Dear Windows 10 user,

the Windows 10 upgrade for the device mentioned at the end of this email is pending for 4 weeks.

As a consequence, your device is going to be marked as in-compliant **in two days** unless you take immediate action.
That means from the day after tomorrow onwards, the way you access digatus data and IT services is going to change and you might even loose access to certain applications until this issue is fully resolved.

Please work together with digatus IT service desk to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
Their contact details can be found on https://s.digat.us/IT-SUPPORT .


Sincerely,
digatus IT
