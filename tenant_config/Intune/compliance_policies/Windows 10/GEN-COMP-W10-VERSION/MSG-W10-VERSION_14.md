```
Dear Windows 10 user,

2 week before we informed you that your device mentioned at the end of this email needs to be upgraded to run a newer version of Windows 10 in order to comply with digatus device security policies.

For desktop devices, the required minimum is Windows 10 version 1709 (OS build 10.0.16299).
For mobile devices, the required minimum is Windows 10 version 1709 (OS build 10.0.15254).

Upgrading the operating system can be an advanced task and for that reason, we are now copying digatus IT service desk on this email, asking to assist you with this. Please expect that they will be contacting you shortly to align on further actions.
If you would like to proactively reach out to the IT service desk, contact details can be found on https://s.digat.us/IT-SUPPORT .

IMPORTANT:
Please note that this issue needs to be ultimately resolved within the next 16 calendar days, otherwise your device is going to be marked as in-compliant.
The consequence is that the way you access digatus data and IT services is going to change, you might even loose access to certain applications until this issue is fully resolved.


Sincerely,
digatus IT
