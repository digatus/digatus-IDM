Dear Windows 10 user,

in order to comply with digatus device security policies, you need to enable BitLocker disk encryption on the device mentioned at the end of this email.

On compatible devices, this is normally only a few clicks if you follow instructions here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-user-help/you-need-to-enable-windows-encryption

However, if you do not feel comfortable with this task or are facing any issues with it, feel free to ask for assistance.
Contact details can be found here: https://s.digat.us/IT-SUPPORT

We will remind you about this in another email after 5 calendar days.

IMPORTANT:
Please note that this issue needs to be ultimately resolved within the next 10 calendar days, otherwise your device is going to be marked as in-compliant.
The consequence is that the way you access digatus data and IT services is going to change, you might even loose access to certain applications until this issue is fully resolved.


Sincerely,
digatus IT
