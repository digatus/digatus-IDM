Dear Windows 10 user,

the enablement of the code integrity setting for the device mentioned at the end of this email is pending for 9 days.

As a consequence, your device is going to be marked as in-compliant **tomorrow** unless you take immediate action.
That means from tomorrow onwards, the way you access digatus data and IT services is going to change and you might even loose access to certain applications until this issue is fully resolved.

Please work together with digatus IT service desk to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
Their contact details can be found on https://s.digat.us/IT-SUPPORT .


Sincerely,
digatus IT
