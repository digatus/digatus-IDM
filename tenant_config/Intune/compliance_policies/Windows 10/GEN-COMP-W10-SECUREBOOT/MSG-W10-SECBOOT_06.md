Dear Windows 10 user,

5 days ago, we informed you that the device mentioned at the end of this email does not comply with digatus security policies.
In order to resolve this, Secure Boot needs to be enabled on your device.

Enabling this setting is an advanced task and for that reason, we are now copying digatus IT service desk on this email, asking to assist you with this issue. Please expect that they will be contacting you shortly to align on further actions.
If you would like to proactively reach out to the IT service desk, contact details can be found on https://s.digat.us/IT-SUPPORT .

IMPORTANT:
Please note that this issue needs to be ultimately resolved within the next 5 calendar days, otherwise your device is going to be marked as in-compliant.
The consequence is that the way you access digatus data and IT services is going to change, you might even loose access to certain applications until this issue is fully resolved.


Sincerely,
digatus IT
