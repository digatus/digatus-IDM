[ACTION REQUIRED] Enable Secure Boot on your Windows 10 device

Message:

```
Dear Windows 10 user,

in order to comply with digatus device security policies, you need to enable Secure Boot settings on the device mentioned at the end of this email.

Enabling this setting is an advanced task. If you feel comfortable with resolving this yourself, you may follow instructions here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-user-help/you-need-to-enable-secure-boot-windows

We would rather recommend to ask for assistance from digatus IT. Find their contact details here:
https://s.digat.us/IT-SUPPORT

We will remind you about this in another email after 5 calendar days.

IMPORTANT:
Please note that this issue needs to be ultimately resolved within the next 10 calendar days, otherwise your device is going to be marked as in-compliant.
The consequence is that the way you access digatus data and IT services is going to change, you might even loose access to certain applications until this issue is fully resolved.


Sincerely,
digatus IT
